"""Residual-ensemble fusion: ``final = clip(xgb + predicted_residual, 0, 1)``.

The ensemble receives the five residual features recorded in the artifact
(``xgb_eos_probability, tft_eos_probability, tft_minus_xgb,
mean_probability, absolute_disagreement``) and the decision threshold comes
from the artifact itself (``residual_threshold`` = 0.93), not a hardcoded
value.
